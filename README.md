# Fasanara Landing Page

This repo hosts the source code for a mockup landing page for Fasanara Capital.

The project is built using React and create-react-app. The code for components can be found in components folder. For styling, pure CSS is used. CSS files are imported for each component for maintenance. There are also general and queries files for CSS in the config folder.

Design choice:
I chose blue as the theme color because it associates with technology and also trust.
